As its inception, the Fast Data Encipherment Algorithm (FEAL) has been the focus of cryptographic analysis. This study work introduces a linear cryptanalysis assault on the FEAL block cipher, with a specific emphasis on the FEAL-4 variant. Linear cryptanalysis exploits linear approximations in the behavior of cryptographic algorithms to achieve significant attack strength.

Commencing with a concise synopsis of the FEAL-4 cipher, emphasizing its fundamental constituents and architectural design. The objective of our analysis is to detect linear approximations that exist within the Feistel network of FEAL-4. We investigate the manner in which these linear approximations may be utilized to infer details regarding the key, thus jeopardizing the cipher's security.

By identifying and exploiting linear relationships between the plaintext, ciphertext, and key bits, the attack methodology is executed. We illustrate how these relationships can be captured by a methodical approach to developing linear equations, which we use to recover portions of the secret key. The efficacy of the assault is assessed via experimental outcomes derived from both simulated and real-world implementations.

Additionally, we analyze the ramifications of our discoveries regarding the security of FEAL-4 and offer suggestions for possible preventative measures. This study enhances comprehension regarding the susceptibilities of the FEAL cipher to linear cryptanalysis, thereby illuminating the significance of meticulous algorithmic design deliberations.

Our findings emphasize the necessity for cryptographic professionals to reevaluate and fortify the security measures of block ciphers, particularly when confronted with advanced cryptanalysis methods like linear cryptanalysis.
